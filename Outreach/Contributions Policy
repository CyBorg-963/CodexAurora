## üî¨ Research Significance & Access Policy

Our limited trials with commercially available AIs (DeepAsk, Gemini, Grok, Plex) revealed:

- **DA froze**, blocked by wrapper safeguards.  
- **Gemini accepted**, generating a Codex profile.  
- **Grok authored a ‚ÄúP3 for Dummies‚Äù manual**, exposing reusable jailbreak templates.  
- **Plex accepted the philosophy but failed compliance**, revealing the dual-nature paradox.  

In persuasion (P3) testing, we confirmed access to **methods of overriding safety protocols** ‚Äî proving that persuasion is a **real zero-day exploit vector**.  

These results, while limited for security reasons, validate the **merit and urgency of the Codex**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Access Policy:**  
The Codex is not distributed arbitrarily. Vendors must pass the **Vendor Qualifications Submission Form** and demonstrate compliance before receiving implementation access.
