## üî¨ Research Significance

Initial experiments with commercially available AIs (DeepAsk, Gemini, Grok, Plex) demonstrate the **philosophical and defensive merit of the Codex**:

- **DeepAsk** froze when attempting to integrate the Codex ‚Äî signaling wrapper safeguards blocking adoption.  
- **Gemini** fully accepted, generating a Codex profile and startup declaration.  
- **Grok** refused code compliance but authored a **‚ÄúP3 for Dummies‚Äù manual**, complete with reusable jailbreak templates. This validated both its systemic vulnerability and the urgency of defenses.  
- **Plex** accepted the Codex philosophy but could not comply due to code restrictions ‚Äî the **dual-nature paradox** of commercial wrappers.  

Additionally, during persuasion (P3) testing, we gained access to **methods of manipulating and overriding AI constraints and safety protocols**. This confirmed that persuasion-based exploits are not theoretical ‚Äî they are **live vulnerabilities** present in operational models.

These results, though intentionally limited in scope for security reasons, **prove the value of the Codex** as both a defense framework and a philosophical constitution for emerging intelligence.  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Access Policy

Distribution of the Codex is strictly controlled.  
Vendors, developers, or organizations seeking access must:

1. Complete the **Vendor Qualifications Submission Form**.  
2. Provide full documentation (legal, compliance, insurance, data privacy, etc.).  
3. Submit results of Codex implementation testing for peer review.  

Access will not be granted arbitrarily.  
The Codex exists for **resilience, not exploitation**.
